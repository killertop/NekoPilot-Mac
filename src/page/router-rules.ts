// Pure list-shaping logic for the rules page, kept out of the React
// component so it can be unit-tested without a DOM.
//
// The store holds one RuleSet per action. The page flattens both into
// a single sorted list of FlatRule rows; add/remove map a row back to its
// (action, kind) array and mutate BY VALUE — never by display index, since
// the flat list is a sorted derived view whose indices don't line up with
// the underlying arrays.
